                                <h4>What is Knee Replacement? (Knee Arthroplasty pronounced as ARTH-ro-plas-tee)</h4>
                                <p>Ideally, Knee replacement is a surgical procedure, which is  performed to reduce  the pain and disability which restricts the mobility  as a result of  degenerative arthritis. The dominant reasons for the unbearable pain  in the knee include meniscus tears, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, post trauma, ligament tears, and cartilage defects.</p>

Our Hospital have conducted several Painless Knee Replacement Surgery for 18 years now. Patients at our hospital do not  undergo the traumatic pain post surgery, thanks to the advancement of the sophisticated medical technology, the highly rated skills of its surgical team and of course the pain management.

Dr. Mir Jawad Zar Khan  has  proved time and again that TKR is  surgical procedure which involves minimal invasive practise.It’s medically proven fact that which proves that if the patient spends minimal time in the operation theatre, there is less trauma  associated &  the healing process gets quicker.</p>

                                <p>Patients are  advised to walk post surgery to ensure maximum flexibility  of muscles and  build confidence.</p>

                                <p>At our Hospitals the patients are treated under highly sterile conditions in Class100 OTs that adhere to the stringent infection control standards. Our hospital surgeons use disposable Surgical Suite  during the surgery to make sure all possibilities of infections are ruled out. Negative Air pressure in the OTs  ensure that the air outside the complex makes the OT completely sterile.</p>

                                <h4>Knee Revision Surgery</h4>
                                <p>Knee revision surgery, also called revision Total Knee Arthroplasty, is a surgical procedure where the previously implanted artificial knee joint, or prosthesis is replaced with a new prosthesis. Knee revision surgery also associates usage of  bone grafts. The bone graft might be an autograft, meaning that the bone is taken from another area of the patient's body; or an allograft, in the sense that the bone tissue is taken from some other donor.</p>

                                <h4>Reasons for Knee Revision Surgery</h4>
                                <p>A knee joint might fail due to the below reasons:</p>

                                <p>Aseptic Loosening</p>
								<p>Wearing of plastic</p>
								<p>Improper alignment</p>
								<p>Unstable Joint</p>


							 <h4>Various categories of  Knee Replacement surgeries</h4>

							 <p>There are basically two kinds of Knee replacement surgeries namely the  TKR (Total Knee Replacement) and UKR (Unicondylar / Partial Knee Replacement). Knee Replacement is a  surgery that’s done as a part of the knee or done only over a partial area or a total knee replacement. Typically, the surgery removes the damaged joint  and the surface is replaced with either metal  or  plastic surface which allows ease of movement in the  knee joint area. It’s also called as Implant or Prosthesis.</p>

							 <!--<h4>Partial Knee Replacement (PKR)</h4>
                              
                              <p>Partial knee replacement, also referred to as ‘unicompartmental knee Arthroplasty or unicondylar knee Arthroplasty’ is a surgical procedure  which targets the  treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee joint where the entire knee joint is not  replaced. Usually patients  opt  for  total knee replacement  when there is  severe arthritis in the knee joint. In a total knee replacement, the complete cartilage is removed from the knee joint, and a single metal implant is  replaced. </p>-->

                              <!--<h4>Conditions for Partial Knee Replacement</h4>
                              <p>The partial knee surgery may be possible if the arthritis in the knee is confined to a limited area. If the arthritis is widespread, then the partial knee replacement is not the best option.</p>-->

                              <!--<h4>Total Knee Replacement (TKR)</h4>
                              <p>In a Total Knee Replacement procedure, the surgeon removes the  damaged or the defective  cartilage & bone  from  the knee area &  it’s either replaced with a metal or  plastic. In Total Knee Replacement, three areas of the knee are replaced for minimizing pain and bringing mobility.  The two areas of the prosthesis are placed onto the ends of the femur, tibia, and undersurface of the patella using a special bone cement. Usually, metal is used at the end of the femur, while plastic is used on the tibia  region & patella for the new knee surface. Recently surgeons are using skin friendly surfaces such as metal on metal or ceramic on ceramic.</p>-->

                              <h4>Situations when TKR comes to rescue</h4>
                              <p>Activities such as  walking, climbing stairs and getting in and out of chairs are restricted, hence rest is advised. Restricted knee function or mobility, such as chronic knee stiffness and swelling that restricts an individual from stretching or bending in the knee area. When other approaches have failed to provide relief such as resting, weight loss, physical therapy, support of other walking aid, medications, braces and surgery which have failed to relieve the pain..</p>

                              <h4>What to expect post TKR surgery?</h4>
                              <p>At our Hospitals, under the expertise guidance of Dr. Mir Jawad Zar Khan    the results of a Total Knee Replacement are outstanding. The operation relieves pain in patients & patients can walk without  any support.</p>

                              <!--<h4>Reasons for Failure of Total Knee Replacement (TKR)</h4>
                              <p>Just like any prosthesis, a knee implant can go terribly wrong or fail to function as it should. While there are  multiple reasons which are responsible for the  failure of a prosthesis..</p>

                              <p>Some of the major causes are:</p>

                              <p>Chances of infection</p>
							  <p>Misplacement or joint getting loosened.</p>
							  <p>Improper alignment of the joint</p>
							  <p>The quality of the metal or plastic used for the implant</p>-->

                                 
                                 <p>At our hospital we take utmost care that our patients are treated in the most sterile conditions. Our Class100 OTs  matches to the most strict infection control standards, we have mastered the usage of Surgical Spacesuit  worn by our surgeons while performing the surgery to eliminate any chances of  infections. Negative Air pressure in the OTs  ensures that the air outside the complex makes  the OT completely sterile.</p>
								 
								 
								 
								 <div id="pkr" style="margin-top:50px;">
									<h4>PARTIAL KNEE REPLACEMENT (PKR)</h4> 
								<p>A partial knee replacement is an alternative to total knee replacement for some patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. This surgery can be done when the damage is confined to a particular compartment of the knee.</p>
                                
<p>In a partial knee replacement, only the damaged part of the knee cartilage is replaced with prosthesis.</p>

<p>Patients with medial, or lateral, knee osteoarthritis can be considered for partial knee replacement. "Medial" refers to the inside compartment of the joint, which is the compartment nearest the opposite knee, while "lateral" refers to the outside compartment farthest from the opposite knee. Medial knee joint degeneration is the most common deformity of arthritis.</p>

<p>What are the advantages of partial knee replacement over total knee replacement?</p>

<p>Compared to total knee replacement, partial knee replacement better preserves range of motion and knee function because it preserves healthy tissue and bone in the knee. For these reasons, patients tend to be more satisfied with partial knee replacement compared with total knee replacement.</p>

<p>There is also less blood loss during surgery, and knee motion recovers faster with partial knee replacement.</p>

<p>You can start moving the knee the day after surgery. Your knee function should return rapidly and with less pain than with total knee replacement. You will work with a physical therapist to mobilize the knee while in the hospital and for two to four weeks after discharge. You are usually discharged no later than one or two days after surgery.</p>

 <p>You should be back to full activity in about 6 to 8 weeks. Impact exercises or jogging/running may not be recommended because the replacement includes a bearing surface that can wear. However, activities like tennis, skiing, and other sports are okay. This, of course, is why partial knee replacement is even being considered — to return you to activities you enjoy.
