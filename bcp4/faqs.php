                                       The primary goals of joint replacement surgery are to restore mobility and to relieve pain. Good evidence-based medicine data reveals that a typical total hip or knee replacement lasts at least 20 years in about 80 percent of patients, which lets patients enjoy their favorite activities without pain. Joint replacement care at Sibley is a truly comprehensive experience; it encompasses the entire process from evaluation through rehabilitation. Care at Sibley includes diagnostic imaging, patient education, surgery and both inpatient and outpatient physical therapy. Sibley also has a skilled nursing facility, The Renaissance, for inpatient rehabilitation, which can be used to assure that any postsurgery issues are completely addressed.

                                       How long does it take for joint replacement surgery to heal completely?

                                       Healing times depend largely on the patientâ€™s overall health, body type and lifestyle. With proper care, rest and therapy, patients heal sufficiently to return to most activities of daily living within several weeks of their procedure. The duration of hospitalization ranges from two days for a shoulder replacement to three to five days following a knee or hip replacement.
