In this disease, an immune system badly sends inflammation to your own healthy tissue causing a lot of pain and swelling in the joints.

								<p>X-rays are helpful in detecting RA at the early stages of the disease. So that these X-rays are further useful to observe whether the disease is progressing or not. In other cases, MRI and ultrasound scan are also used to judge the severity of RA.</p>
