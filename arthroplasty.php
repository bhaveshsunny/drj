								<h4>STEP TOWARDS OUR SOPHISTICATED SERVICES</h4> 
								<h4>Anthroplasty:</h4> 
								<p>Arthroplasty is a surgical procedure to restore the function of a joint. A joint can be restored by resurfacing the bones. An artificial joint (called prosthesis) may also be used.</p>
								<p>It is performed to relieve pain and restore range of motion by realigning or reconstructing a dysfunctional joint.</p>
								<p>The goal of arthroplasty is to restore the function of a stiffened synovial joint and relieve pain. As a surgical procedure, it is usually performed when medical treatment has not improved function in the affected joint.</p>
								<p>In recent years, joint replacement has become the operation of choice for most chronic knee and hip problems, particularly because of advances in the type and quality of prostheses (artificial joints). Elbow, shoulder, ankle, and finger joints are more likely to be treated with joint resection or interposition reconstruction.</p>
								<p>Arthroplasty is performed on people suffering from severe pain and disabling stiffness</p>
								<h4>CONDITIONS </h4>
								<p>Osteoarthritis (OA), a degenerative joint disease, is the most common condition causing joint destruction with pain and impaired movement. </p>
								<p><strong>Other causes </strong></p>
								<ul>
								<li>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), </li>
								<li>Hemophilia</li>
								 <li>sinusitis</li>
								<li>Rare bone diseases, which are all known to destroy cartilage. </li>
								</ul>
								<h4>MEDICAL TREATMENTS</h4>
								
								<ul>
								<li>Anti-inflammatory medicines</li>
								<li>Pain medicines</li>
								<li>Limiting painful activities</li>
								<li>Assistive devices for walking (such as a cane)</li>
								<li>Physical therapy</li>
								<li>Cortisone injections into a knee joint</li>
								<li>Viscosupplementation injections (to add lubrication into the joint to make joint movement less painful)</li>
								<li>Weight loss (for obese people)</li>
								<li>Exercise and conditioning</li>
								</ul>
								
								<p>Joint replacement is usually reserved for older patients, because of the limited longevity of benefits. The younger the patient, the greater the reliance on medical treatment.</p>
								<p><strong>HIGH LIGHTS</strong></p>
								<p>The well experienced  joint replacement team of Human Touch Hospital in India, conducts replacement surgeries for knee, hip, shoulder, ankle and elbow.</p>
								<p>We have  specially designed complex of 4 operating theatres with advanced processes, such as laminar airflows, specialized coating of the walls of the theater which are seamless, and the special coating of the flooring which is antistatic and bacterial and fungal resistant;  provides a highly sterile environment essential to avoid post surgery infections.</p>
								<p>Availability of computer assisted / navigation joint-replacement surgery has substantially increased accuracy of the surgery.</p>
								
								
								<h4>TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT</h4>
								<p>The hip is one of the body's largest joints. </p>
								 <p>The most common cause of chronic hip pain and disability is arthritis. Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and traumatic arthritis are the most common forms of this disease.</p>
								 <p>In a total hip replacement (also called total hip arthroplasty), the damaged bone and cartilage is removed and replaced with prosthetic components.</p>
								 <p><strong>TYPES</strong></p>
								 <ul>
								 <li>Cemented</li>
								<li>Uncemented</li>
								<li>Hybrid</li>
								</ul>
								
								<p>There are different bearing options and suited to your requirements by the surgeon. Modern hip replacement materials and bearings are very durable and reliable and rarely break. A good implant and bearing is the key to long-term success of your hip in addition of course to the quality of surgery.</p>
								<p>There are no absolute age or weight restrictions for total hip replacements.</p>
								<p>Recommendations for surgery are based on a patient's pain and disability, not age. Most patients who undergo total hip replacement are age 50 to 80, but orthopaedic surgeons evaluate patients individually. Total hip replacements have been performed successfully at all ages, from the young teenager with juvenile arthritis to the elderly patient with degenerative arthritis and facilitating early mobilization.</p>
								<p>There are in-house physiotherapists to provide pre-op and early post-op care and mobilization and also provide at-home services.</p>
								<p>Total hip arthroplasties are also performed for complex cases leading to good results like:</p>
								
								<ul>
								<li>Post-traumatic arthritis of the hip after acetabular fractures</li>
								<li>Heterotopic ossification of the hip joint</li>
								<li>Ankylosing spondylitis</li>
								<li>Revision for failed total hip arthroplasties</li>
									</ul>
								
								<p><strong>IMPLANT ADVANCES</strong></p>
								<p>Total knee replacement, or total knee arthroplasty, is a surgical procedure in which diseased parts of the knee joint are replaced with artificial parts (prostheses)</p>
								<p>The primary goal is relief of significant, disabling pain caused by severe arthritis.</p>
								<p>Knee replacement is done when other treatments (weight loss, exercise/physical therapy, medicines, and injections) have failed to relieve arthritis-associated knee pain.</p>
								<p>Knee replacement facilitates to relieve pain, improve quality of life, and maintain or improve knee function.</p>
								<p>The procedure can be performed on people of all ages, with the exception of children, whose bones are still growing. </p>
								<p>It is important to have significant pain and/or disability prior to considering this procedure. It is recommended to delay knee replacement until it is absolutely necessary and adviced by orthopedic surgeon after thorough evaluation because the replacement parts can break down over time and lead to increased revision rates. </p>
								<p><strong>ALTERNATIVES TO KNEE REPLACEMENT</strong></p>
								<p>Nonsurgical treatment</p>
								<p><strong>Weight loss.</strong> The knee sees about four pounds of pressure for each pound of body weight, so even a small amount of weight loss (eg, 10 to 15 lbs) can lead to reduced pain.</p>
								<p><strong>Exercise/physical therapy.</strong>  Strengthening the muscles around the knee help take pressure off the knee. Motion of the joint helps to keep it from getting stiff.</p>
								<p><strong>Medications, including over-the-counter and prescription.</strong> These include pain relievers such as acetaminophen and antiinflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen or naproxen. Patients should discuss use of these medications with their primary care provider and pharmacist to be sure the risk of side effects is acceptably low</p>
								<p>Knee bracing or shoe inserts, both of which may help align the knee and balance the weight on the joint.</p>
								<p>Injections, either with a cortisone-like drug or a hyaluronic acid derivative. </p>
								
								<h4>Arthroscopy </h4>
								<h4>Osteotomy </h4>
								<h4>Partial knee replacement</h4>
								
								<p>Types of TKA prostheses include the following:</p>
								<ul>
								<li>Fixed bearing</li>
								<li>Medial pivot</li>
								<li>Rotating platform and mobile bearing</li>
								<li>Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)-retaining</li>
								<li>PCL-substituting</li>
								<li>High flex knee</li>
								</ul>
								
								<p>We in HTH thoroughly evaluate the patient clinically and measure knee scores and advice surgery when alternative medical and surgical treatment have been exhausted. The patient is given complete knowledge regarding the procedure and implants. Pre operative physiotherapy is adviced to strengthen the muscles. Early post op CPM is given. Early and painless mobilization with no complications is the goal of surgery.</p>
								<h4>PARTIAL KNEE REPLACEMENT</h4>
								<p>Partial knee replacement ( unicompartmental knee replacement) is a procedure in which only a portion of the knee is resurfaced. This procedure is an alternative to total knee replacement for patients whose disease is limited to just one area of the knee.</p>
								<p>In knee osteoarthritis, the cartilage protecting the bones of the knee slowly wears away. This can occur throughout the knee joint or just in a single area of the knee.</p>
								<p>Advanced osteoarthritis that is limited to a single compartment may be treated with a unicompartmental knee replacement. More than 25% of patients with severe knee arthritis may be appropriate candidates for this type of surgery.  During this procedure, the damaged compartment is replaced with metal and plastic. The healthy cartilage and bone, as well as all of the ligaments are preserved. </p>
								<p>Due to technological advances, more people with knee arthritis are now able to benefit from partial knee replacement.  The life of a partial knee replacement is almost comparable to that of a total knee replacement. On average, there 10-year survival rate of 95% and 20 year survival rate of 80%.</p>
								<p>This is a minimally invasive procedure is an alternative option for arthritis patients in whom only one part of the knee has been affected. </p>
								<p>Partial replacements are becoming more attractive to patients due to:</p>
								<ul>
								<li>Higher patient satisfaction</li>
								<li>Preserving more normal knee motion</li>
								<li>Less blood loss during surgery</li>
								<li>Faster recovery time</li>

								</ul>
								
								
								<p>With proper patient selection, modern unicompartmental knee replacements have demonstrated excellent medium- and long-term results in both younger and older patients.</p>
