								<h4>Foot and Ankle Surgery</h4> 
								<p>Foot and ankle surgery is a sub-set of orthopedics and podiatry that deals with the treatment, diagnosis, and anticipation of syndromes of the foot and ankle. Foot and ankle specialists in the Department of Orthopedic Surgery use leading-edge science and technology to extravagance a wide series of musculoskeletal situations and to escape the use of needless medical tests and processes whenever probable. The methodology is broad and contains all features of the focus from basic science to clinical supervision. Difficulties of both children and adults are involved, as is trauma and chronic disease. The direct arrival of swelling in the area is due to internal bleeding. Most ankle injuries can be accomplished conventionally. Rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) therapy are introduced as soon as possible next an acute sprain</p> 
                      
								<h4>Chronic Ankle Sprain:</h4>

								<h4>Lateral Ankle Sprain:</h4>
								<p>Lateral ankle tendon healing/renovation are a common surgical technique commenced in patients with chronic lateral ankle instability. To reinstate stability, the anterior talofibular tendon and the calcaneofibular tendons are stiffened by double breasting (overlapping the coatings) or by preceding their add-on on the fibula.</p>
                         
								<h4>Achilles tendon Rupture:</h4>
								<p>Acute Achilles tendon rupture happens just proximal to the site of its supplement in the calcaneus. When exaggerated patients are placed in the lying position, the loss of plantar flexion tone is apparent on comparison of both sides.</p>

								<p> <strong> Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) </strong>is the most habitually used procedure to heal ankle fractures. Open reduction refers to an operative rearrangement of the fractured bones, and internal fixation denotes to the use of metal plates and/or screws to protect the bones in the exact position. Metal plates have been sighted in position on the back of the fibula and the posterior malleolus. These plates are used to protect the fractures.</p>

								<h5>Arthrodesis</h5>
								<p>Merging your phalanges together, which leaves your toe more constant but means you’ll only be able to wear flat shoes after the process.</p>
								<p>Both procedures are done during day day  and last about an hour. Your stitches will be detached about two to three weeks next surgery and you will require another bandage for two to six weeks after that. You should decide how much you can walk for the first three days.</p>
