								<h4>Medical preparation:</h4>
								<p>The preparation for this type of surgeries includes the precise assessment of body parts. Skin grafts need an evaluation of certain areas of skin for the perfect color and texture that matches to the skin at the graft site. Facelifts and cosmetic surgery in the eye area require very keen observation to the texture of the skin and placing of surgical cuts (incisions).</p>
								<p>People who undergo plastic surgery are given general anesthesia. Sample of  blood and urine are collected and tested to rule out health disorders. Patients are suggested to take minimal medications containing aspirin  a week or two prior to surgery as these  drugs prolong the time of blood clotting. People with the habit of smoking need to quit smoking two weeks prior surgery as it interferes with the healing procedure. If there is a need for transfusion during operation, then patients have to donate some units of blood. The prospective patient will be asked to sign a consent form before the operation.</p>
